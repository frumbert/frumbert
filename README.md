### I'm Tim ðŸ‘‹

aka _frumbert_. Here's some of my links around the net: [MMORPG](https://www.mmorpg.com/users/frumbert)'s, [programming](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1238884/frumbert), [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/frumbert), [music](http://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_artist_modules&query=91662), sites from [the 90's](https://web.archive.org/web/19991005/http:/members.xoom.com/frumbert), and social sites so numerous I've [forgotten](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=frumbert&s=l) [them](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/http://frumbert.org) [all](https://b3ta.com/users/profile.php?id=7508). I work in the field of **e-learning**.

What you'll find here mostly relates to my work in e-learning, and of late predominantly with the [Moodle](https://mooodle.org) platform, the PHP language (though I do occasionally have to tinker in classic asp), and pure javascript apps.
