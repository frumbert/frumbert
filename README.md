### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tim. The moniker/nic/tag/avatar _frumbert_ has been attached to me in all my internet days. It came about when I needed an account to test out the [then new] Microsoft Mail server on Windows NT 3? 3.5? Who even remembers? And I made it up and it's been with me ever since, through IRC networks, MMORPG's, programming, photography and social sites so numerous I've [forgotten](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=frumbert&s=l) [them](https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/http://frumbert.org) [all](https://b3ta.com/users/profile.php?id=7508). I work in the field of **e-learning**.

I class myself more as a tinkerer than a programmer even though that has been my official title for two decades now. I've been a computer install & repair guy. I repair rather than replace (dishwashers and washing machines, macbooks, original xboxes, faucet breeches, door hinges, cheap drawer runners, steam irons, lawnmowers, you name it). I have a tendency to make do with the tools available, including in programming. I have to admit to being one of the probably two people left on the internet still maintaining a Classic ASP server running a production tool. Because it worked long ago and still does.

What you'll find here mostly relates to my work in e-learning, and of late predominantly with the [Moodle](https://mooodle.org) platform. This has a rich community of plugins and an even wider community of developers. I don't have a showcase website just at the moment because I've been too busy concentrating on clients who do pay, rather than those that might.
